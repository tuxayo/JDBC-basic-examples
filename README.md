===================

JDBC usage examples as part of object-relational mapping classes

###How to test?
You need a running MySQL (or MariaDB)
run [this script](./databaseDeploymentScript/deploy.bash) to load the test dataset. (Adapt it to your own configuration)

You will find sources and binaries in [./TP_JDBC](./TP_JDBC)

Warning: Do not use this as a reference, a lot (if not all) of the code sucks despite efforts to clean it!
